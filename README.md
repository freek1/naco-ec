# Natural Computing - Evolutionary Computing

Assignment from the course Natural Computing 2023 at the Radboud University.

## Assignment
Implementing several evolutionary computing methods:
  - 4.1: Fitness function and proportional selection
  - 4.2: Genetic algorithm for finding a random bit sequence (crossover and mutation)
  - 4.3: Simple evolutionary- and memetic algorithms (using crossover, mutation, and 2-opt) for Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
  - 4.4: String search genetic algorithm (with tournament selection)
